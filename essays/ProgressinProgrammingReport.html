As we are nearing the ennd of the semester I am starting to see real improvement in my javascript skills. I have noticed that it is easier to form code naturally without thinkinng about it as much. As write more and more codeI become more enthusiastic about programming, when I first started I really disliked it, but as it becomes easier I am realizin the potential that is there. Although, I am becoming more comfortable with coding I still occasionally do need to review the screen casts for the WODS. I am okay with this becuase I am still learning and watching the screenn cast gives me the oppurtunity to learn from my mistakes. The labs are useful becuase it gives me something to follow along with in class. I think with all my combined skills from this class I am ready to move on to simple web appliactions. One thing that I think could be improved with the class is more interaction with the students and the TA, reaching out to a TA for assistance can be useful. The class moving online has actually been really benefitial in my opinion, its easier to follow along with the proffessor.
