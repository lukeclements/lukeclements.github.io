Eventually I was able to finish each BrowserHistory WOD, but when I first tried each of them I DNF. Since I did not finish in time, I decided to watch the screen cast as I am a visual learner and I thought this would be the best way for me to learn. BrowserHistory1 was the hardest for me, it was laying the framework for the other two, so I wanted to make sure that it completely functioned. After watching the screencast once, I attempted the WOD. This time I finished in SD however it was very close at 24 minutes. I definitely think that I could have finished quicker, but I was taking my time to make sure that I did not miss a step or make a stupid mistake. Once I did BrowserHistory1 the other two seemed a lot easier. I completed the other two in RX. The most difficult part for me was getting the server running.
