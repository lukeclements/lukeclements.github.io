In the WOD's that I have done so far I have practiced: developing a web page using basic HTML, developing a web page using basic CSS and Google web fonts, developing a web page using chrome developer tools, practiced client side processing usign JS, and using JS to generate a sales receipt.  When I first tried each of them I DNF. Since I did not finish in time, I decided to watch the screen cast as I am a visual learner and I thought this would be the best way for me to learn. Before I would do each WOD I would do the readings and go over the labs, and then I would do the WOD for the first time as slowly as possible just so I couldmake sure I fully understood it. In the future I think I will try to do it more than two times just so I can get it down perfectly.
