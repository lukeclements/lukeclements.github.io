The goal of assignment 2 is to further develop our ecommerce webiste, the major new feature we will be adding is a login/registration. This assignemnt taught me some baisc web page security and how logins and registrations function. I did not have a partner for this assignment so I relied on the proffessor when I needed help. I was havign some server isssues which were resolved when I reached out for help from the proffessor. Developing was different for this assignemnt becuase it was more detailed, assignment 1 was layign the foundation and this one was adding more features. My breakdown for developing was 20% thinking about how to do something, 30% writing code, and the most time consuming was 50% testing and debugging. Pretty much everythign worked well with my project the only issue with it is the data validation. If I could go back in time I would start earlier on the project.
